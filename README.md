# ItemShift
ItemShift is a spigot plugin developed to help combat item buildup when a player is removing large a amount of blocks or mining blocks in hard to reach areas such as the sky. It is very barebones with a simple goal, to move the dropped items to the players inventory when mined. Feature requests will be considered but the scope will not likley change.
